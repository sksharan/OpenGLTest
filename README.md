OpenGLTest is a C++ program for Windows that I’ve been writing to learn more about OpenGL and graphics programming in general. The code can be built and run via the Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file included with the source code. Support for OpenGL 3.3 or higher is required to run the program.

Features
--------
<br>•	Generation of procedural, multi-textured landscapes using Perlin noise, and procedurally-generated grass
<br>• Chunking algorithm for landscapes that allows for infinite worlds
<br>•	Object creation via Wavefront OBJ files (files that encode information about 3D models)
<br>•	Terrain creation via height maps (greyscale images that encode height information)
<br>•	Users can generate a set of predefined objects through simple key presses
<br>• Users can apply affine transformations to these objects and change the way that they are rendered
<br>•	Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) and Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) for each object, allowing for mouse picking
<br>•	Multiple point lights can be placed, each implementing the Phong reflection model per-fragment
